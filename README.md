### Intro  
eMarket is free software for anyone. This online store is available to anyone without any obligation or payment. GNU GPL Free License v. 3.0. The project was founded on March 10, 2018.

### What is all this for?
We have been doing online storers for a long time. Basically, everyone thinks about the buyer. But what about the manager? Many functions in third-party stores are unnecessarily overloaded for the manager. To perform a simple action, you need to configure several different settings pages. Adding and editing products for the manager turns into torture. Stores make for programmers, not managers. Few people think about the convenience for the manager. But it is the manager who has to do the main work with the store. Have you thought about this?

### Yes! And we thought about it!
We decided to make great efforts to create a more convenient online store. We spend much more time to solve the problem if we understand that it is possible to significantly facilitate the work of the store manager. We do not really consider the time spent on programming, if we understand that it is possible and necessary to make a certain function more convenient for the manager. We just take it and do it as needed, if we understand that it will be convenient for people. Everything that used to be done on multiple settings pages is now done with a few clicks. And we do not intend to stop there.

### Why your own engine?
We ditched PHP frameworks in favor of our own engine to fully control the development process. We want to show what we can do better, because it is done for people. Its own engine complicates the development at the initial stage, but gives huge opportunities after a while. We try to do better, even if we see that it will take longer.

### What about the buyer?
For us, the buyer is as important as the manager, and therefore we pay this side the same close attention as the manager. And it will always be so.

### Why Free Software?
We believe that the future belongs to free software. Everyone should be able to obtain the source code of the program to prevent any possible manipulation by individuals, corporations or governments. And we support this.

If we see what can be done "better" or "faster", then we always try to choose "better", and spend time on it. After all, we do everything for people. And this is important!

You can support our project in any form: with money, information support, assistance in development or translation into other languages of the world. You can just be with us. And that's great.

Regards, eMarket Team.
